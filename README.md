#### About Me

- Currently working on [**Fossify**](https://github.com/FossifyOrg). A collection of privacy-focused, open-source mobile apps.
- In my free time, I tinker with microcontrollers and drones, and spend quality time with my 3D printer.
- Fun fact: I had a rabbit who used to supervise my coding sessions.
