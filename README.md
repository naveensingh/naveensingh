#### About Me

- Iâ€™m a freelance software developer with expertise in mobile and web development.
- Currently working on [**Fossify**](https://github.com/FossifyOrg). A collection of privacy-focused and fully open-source mobile apps.
- In my free time, I tinker around with microcontrollers, build drones and explore the intersection of hardware and software.
- Fun fact: I have a rabbit who occasionally supervises my coding sessions.
